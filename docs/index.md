# quisc

First and foremost, `quisc` is an implementation of the
[QUIC](https://quicwg.org/) transport protocol. However, the mission of the
project covers a wider scope, including generally how to build and maintain a
large software project written exclusively in RISC-V assembly, as well as how
[user space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_space_and_kernel_space)
networking software interacts with an operating system.

In service of these goals, the `quisc` documentation provides both practical and
informational content.
